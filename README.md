# 📸 Memory Drop

**Memory Drop** is a full-stack web application built using the **PERN stack** (PostgreSQL, Express.js, React.js, Node.js). It allows users to upload, view, and manage personal memories in the form of images with descriptions. The app is styled with Tailwind CSS and enhanced with smooth animations for an engaging experience.

## ✨ Features

- 🔐 User Authentication (via localStorage)
- 🖼️ Upload images and descriptions as "memories"
- 📂 View all your memories in a clean dashboard
- 🗑️ Delete individual memories
- 🎨 Smooth animations (e.g., drop-down and slide-in)
- ⚙️ Backend built with PostgreSQL + TypeORM
